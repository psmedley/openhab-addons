# TeslaPowerwall Binding

This binding enables the capture of key data from a Tesla Powerwall 2 into openHAB.

## Supported Things

Tesla Powerwall 2

## Discovery

No auto discovery. The IP of the Powerwall should be added to /etc/hosts and a hostname powerwall used in the binding.

## Thing Configuration

As a minimum, the IP address is needed:
* hostname - The hostname of the Tesla Powerwall 2. Defaults to powerwall to avoid SSL certificate issues
* email - the email of the local account on the Powerwall that the installer provided
* password - the password of the local account on the Powerwall that the installer provided
* refresh - The frequency with which to refresh information from the Tesla Powerwall2 specified in seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
